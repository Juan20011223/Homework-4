Nobody know until this day but what I can take out of this case is that it surelly brings fear to our privacy and information.From what I have researched the information that was used to acuse him wasnt strong enough and wasnt credible enough bringing some kind of uncertainty to the case. But in conclusion it doesnt matter if he is guilty or not its definetely something to fear in the future.Technology is advancing at a big rate and us being a third world country can be vulnerable to this kind of attacks so its better to be cautious of to who you are giving your information."

They must align because they explain how they collect and use the information or each user.Tik Tok and Whatsapp give full transparency on how they collect information.They also have information on how much time do they retain the info.\n",
